# Token Refresh System - Implementation Guide

## User Story & Business Value
Users need seamless access to their personal data stored in Dropbox without interruptions due to expired tokens. The system should automatically maintain valid authentication tokens while providing transparency about forced logouts for monitoring purposes.

## Core User Flow

### Primary Flow: Transparent Token Management
1. User performs any action that requires Dropbox API access
2. System automatically validates token before making the request
3. If token is expired, system silently refreshes it using refresh token
4. Original API call proceeds with fresh token
5. User experiences no interruption or delay

### Fallback Flow: Token Refresh Failure
1. System detects expired token and attempts refresh
2. Refresh token is invalid or API call fails
3. System performs clean logout procedure
4. User receives subtle notification about session expiration
5. System logs the forced logout for monitoring purposes

## Technical Architecture Principles

### Centralized Token Management
- Single point of control in DropboxService
- Automatic token validation before every API request
- Transparent token refresh without user intervention
- Clean separation between auth logic and business logic

### Simplified Error Handling Strategy
- Pre-request validation using interceptor pattern eliminates most 401 errors
- No retry mechanisms to avoid complexity and potential infinite loops
- Graceful degradation when refresh fails with forced logout
- Simple logging for debugging and monitoring
- Clean authentication state management in context

### State Management Integration
- DropboxService handles all token operations internally
- Authentication context only manages UI state and user notifications
- Preserve user data during token operations when possible
- Minimal impact on existing components

## Implementation Requirements

### Token Storage & Validation
- Store access token with expiration timestamp
- Store refresh token securely in localStorage
- Validate token expiration before each API call (5-minute buffer)
- Automatic cleanup of invalid tokens

### Refresh Token Logic
- Exchange refresh token for new access token before API calls
- Update stored tokens with new values using centralized method
- Handle refresh token expiration gracefully with forced logout
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing auth flow

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Simple console logging for forced logout events
- No complex counters or statistics tracking
- Clear debugging information for troubleshooting
- Enable monitoring of authentication health through logs

### User Experience
- Completely transparent token management
- No loading states or interruptions during refresh
- Subtle notifications only when logout is required
- Preserve user's current location and state

## Integration Points

### DropboxService Enhancement
- Add `ensureValidToken()` method called before each API request
- Implement `refreshAccessToken()` using stored refresh token
- Centralize token data creation with `createTokenData()` helper
- Update all existing API methods to use token interceptor
- Maintain existing method signatures and behavior

### Authentication Context Simplification
- Remove complex token monitoring logic
- Handle forced logout notifications from service layer
- Update auth state when service indicates logout occurred
- Trigger appropriate UI notifications
- Preserve existing authentication flow

### Error Handling Integration
- Centralized token validation in service layer before requests
- Consistent logout procedure when token refresh fails
- Integration with existing toast notification system
- Proper cleanup of user data and cache

## Success Metrics
- Elimination of 401 errors in normal operation
- Reduced user authentication friction
- Simple monitoring through console logs
- Maintained user session duration

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Priorities
- Token expiration and refresh scenarios
- Refresh token failure handling
- Integration with existing authentication flow
- User experience during token operations

### Monitoring Requirements
- Console logs for forced logout events
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Simple tracking through browser developer tools
- Provide debugging data for support

This simplified system ensures users maintain seamless access to their personal data while providing the basic monitoring capabilities needed to track authentication issues through simple console logging.
